     <h1>KINGDOM OF UK </h1>
	 <p>Great Britain is an island in the North Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe. 
	 With an area of 209,331 km2 (80,823 sq mi), it is the largest of the British Isles, the largest European island, and the ninth-largest island in the world.
	 [6][note 1] The island is dominated by a maritime climate with narrow temperature differences between seasons. 
	 The island of Ireland is situated to the west of Great Britain, and together these islands,
	 along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands, form the British Isles archipelago.[8]
      Connected to mainland Europe until 8,000 years ago, Great Britain has been inhabited by modern humans for around 30,000 years. 
	  In 2011, the island had a population of about 61 million people, 
	  making it the world's third-most populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan.[9][10]
      The term "Great Britain" is often used to refer to England, Scotland and Wales, including their component adjoining islands.
     Great Britain and Northern Ireland now constitute the United Kingdom.[12] 
     The single Kingdom of Great Britain resulted from the 1707 Acts of Union between the kingdoms of England (which at the time incorporated Wales) and Scotland.

	 The archipelago has been referred to by a single name for over 2000 years:
	 the term 'British Isles' derives from terms used by classical geographers
	 to describe this island group. By 50 BC Greek geographers were using equivalents 
	 of Prettanikē as a collective name for the British Isles.
	 However, with the Roman conquest of Britain the Latin term Britannia was used for the 
	 island of Great Britain, and later Roman-occupied Britain south of Caledonia.[14][15][16]
   The earliest known name for Great Britain is Albion (Greek: Ἀλβιών) or insula Albionum, 
   from either the Latin albus meaning "white" (possibly referring to the white cliffs of Dover,
   the first view of Britain from the continent) or the "island of the Albiones".[17] 
   The oldest mention of terms related to Great Britain was by Aristotle (384–322 BC), or possibly by Pseudo-Aristotle,
   in his text On the Universe, Vol. III. To quote his works, "There are two very large islands in it,
   called the British Isles, Albion and Ierne</p>

      Greek geographer, Pytheas of Massalia The first known written use of the word Britain was an 
	  ancient Greek transliteration of the original P-Celtic term in a work on the travels and discoveries
	  of Pytheas that has not survived. The earliest existing records of the word are quotations of the
	  periplus by later authors, such as those within Strabo's Geographica, Pliny's Natural History and
	  Diodorus of Sicily's Bibliotheca historica.[19] Pliny the Elder (AD 23–79) in his Natural History 
	  records of Great Britain: "Its former name was Albion; but at a later period, all the islands, of which we shall
	  just now briefly make mention, were included under the name of 'Britanniæ.'"[20]</p><p>

     The name Britain descends from the Latin name for Britain, Britannia or Brittānia, 
	 the land of the Britons. Old French Bretaigne (whence also Modern French Bretagne) 
	 and Middle English Bretayne, Breteyne. The French form replaced the Old English Breoton,
	 Breoten, Bryten, Breten (also Breoton-lond, Breten-lond). Britannia was used by the Romans 
	 from the 1st century BC for the British Isles taken together. It is derived from the travel
	 writings of Pytheas around 320 BC, which described various islands in the North Atlantic 
	 as far north as Thule (probably Norway).</p>
