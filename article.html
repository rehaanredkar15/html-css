		     The flexbox model exists for a reason. 
			 Floats and inline-blocks work, but they are all essentially 
			 tools for styling documents, not websites. Flexbox on the other 
			 hand is specifically designed to make it easy to create any 
			 layout exactly the way it was envisioned.
              The set of properties that come with the flexbox model give
			  developers lots of flexibility (no pun intended), and once 
			  you get used to them, doing any responsive layout is a piece
			  of cake. Browser support nowadays is almost perfect, so there
			  shouldn't be anything stopping you from going full flexbox.

					Although the situation has greatly improved over the years,
					there is still plenty of variation in the way different browsers
					behave. The best way to resolve this issue is to apply a CSS
					reset that sets universal default values for all elements,
					allowing you to start working on a clean style sheet that will
					yield the same result everywhere.
					There are libraries like normalize.css, minireset, 
					and ress that do this very well, correcting all imaginable
					browser inconsistencies. If you don't want to use a library,
					you can do a very basic CSS reset yourself with these styles:

			  When adding images to your design,
			  especially if it's going to be responsive,
			  use a  tag with the background CSS property
			  instead of  elements.
              This may seem like more work for nothing, 
			  but it actually makes it much easier to style images properly,
			  keeping their original size and aspect-ratio,
			  thanks to background-size, background-position,
			  and other properties.
